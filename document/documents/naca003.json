NACA-003 has extreme post traumatic stress disorder from a mistaken creation; in an attempt to create something, he accidentally made NACA-003-A, a dangerous smoke cloud that gets stronger when NACA-003 is feeling strong negative emotions. NACA-003 also yearns to always be in the field of NACA-002, as it dampens his strength and makes him less likely to accidentally make dangerous objects.",
    "containment": "003 likes to be near 002, as to limit his chance of mistakes, so a box is placed above his room to make NACA-003 believe that NACA-002 is always above him. NACA-003’s room is made of stainless steel. The effects of 002 are always present, as they echo for around 24 hours before weakening, and goes away fully after 48",
