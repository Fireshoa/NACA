NACA-003 has extreme post traumatic stress disorder from a mistaken creation; in an attempt to create something, he accidentally made NACA-003-A, a dangerous smoke cloud that gets stronger when NACA-003 is feeling strong negative emotions. NACA-003 also yearns to always be in the field of NACA-002, as it dampens his strength and makes him less likely to accidentally make dangerous objects.",
